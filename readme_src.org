* Raw Data
- =googlebooks-eng-all-1gram-20120701-*.csv=
Tab-separated ngrams data. Example below: In 1978, the word "circumvallate", occurred 335 times overall, in 91 distinct books.\\
: circumvallate   1978   335    91

- =total_counts.csv=
Records the total number of 1-grams contained in the books. Example below: In 1505, the number of total words recorded is 32059, from 231 pages, 1 book.:
: 1505,32059,231,1

- =synsets.csv=
Lists of all the noun synsets in WordNets. The first field is the synset id (an integer), the second field is the synset, and the third field is its definition:
: 36,AND_circuit AND_gate,a circuit in a computer that fires only when all of its inputs fire

- =hyponyms.csv=
Contains the hyponym relationships: The first field is a synset id; subsequent fields are the ids of the synset's direct hyponyms:
: 79537,38611,9007

* Analyses
** Average word length history
[[./output/pics/word_length.png][analysis1]]\\
*Observation:*\\
The average word length was slowly increasing across the history and reached its peak at 6.947 chars/word in 1979.\\
** socialism vs. capitalism
[[./output/pics/ideology.png][analysis2]]\\
*Observation:*\\
The two ideology were mentioned most around 1940 and 1980. They are losing momentum quickly in recent years.\\
** Hyponyms of increase vs. decrease
[[./output/pics/hyponyms_pie.png][analysis3]]\\
*Observation:*\\
People didn't tend to use "decrease" to express its meanings. It wasn't even among the top 15 of its own hyponyms.\\
** Zipf's Law
[[./output/pics/zipfs.png][analysis4]]\\
*Observation:*\\
All loglog plots show a straight line, which means the frequency of words is proportional to the rank. It's an interesting fact since the ranking of a word shouldn't have any numerical properties.\\
** Four classical elements
[[./output/pics/hyponyms_box.png][analysis5]]\\
*Observation:*\\
Many words have related meanings with the 4 classical elements. In 2000 their "strength" is in the order of air > earth > water > fire. Words relating to "fire" is barely used.
