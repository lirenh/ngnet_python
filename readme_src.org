* Goal:

- NGram:
- WordNet :: [[https://wordnet.princeton.edu/][A lexical database groups words into sets of synonyms (synsets) and describes semantic relationships between them.]]
- Synsets :: a set of synonyms.
- Hyponym :: More specific synset. A carrot is a hyponym of plant.
- Hypernym :: More general synset. A plant is a hypernym of carrot.

* Raw Data:
- googlebooks-eng-all-1gram-20120701-*.csv\\
Tab-separated ngrams data. In 1978, the word "circumvallate", occurred 335 times overall, in 91 distinct books:\\
: circumvallate   1978   335    91


- totalcounts.csv\\
Records the total number of 1-grams contained in the books that make up the corpus. In 1505, the number of total words recorded is 32059, from 231 pages, 1 book:
: 1505,32059,231,1


- synsets.csv\\
Lists of all the (noun) synsets in WordNets. The first field is the synset id (an integer), the second field is the synset, and the third field is its definition:
: 36,AND_circuit AND_gate,a circuit in a computer that fires only when all of its inputs fire

- hyponym.csv\\
