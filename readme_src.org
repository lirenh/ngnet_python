* Data
/All ngrams data pushed to github is dummy data with 10k entries/file since original data is more than 30GB/
** NGrams data
NGrams(1-grams) raw data contains all kinds of words, including nouns, adverbs, adjectives etc. Many words contains special characters.\\
The following example: In 1879, the noun "A'Ang", occurred 45 times overall, in 5 distinct books:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./raw_data/ngrams/*

| A'Aang_NOUN      | 1879 | 45 | 5 |
| A'que_ADJ        | 1897 |  7 | 7 |
| anserinus_NOUN   | 1984 | 44 | 9 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Noun only ngrams, with their postfixes removed:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./output/ngrams_noun/*

| word      | year | count | sources |
|-----------+------+-------+---------|
| A'Aang    | 1879 |    45 |       5 |
| anserinus | 1984 |    44 |       9 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Lowercase, alphabetic only ngrams:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./output/ngrams_lower_alpha/*

| word      | year | count | sources |
|-----------+------+-------+---------|
| anserinus | 1984 |    44 |       9 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Records the total number of 1-grams contained in the books.\\
The following example: In 2008, 19482936409 words in 108811006 pages from 206272 distinct sources were recorded:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./output/total_counts.csv

| year | total_words | pages     | sources |
|------+-------------+-----------+---------|
| 2008 | 19482936409 | 108811006 |  206272 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

** WordNet data
All the noun synsets (synonyms) in WordNets:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./output/wordnet/synsets.csv

| id | synset               | definition                                                          |
|----+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 36 | AND_circuit AND_gate | a circuit in a computer that fires only when all of its inputs fire |
#+END_EXAMPLE
Direct Hyponyms (more specific synset) information e.g. (change, modification) -> (damage, harm).\\
1st field is a synset id; subsequent fields are the ids of its direct hyponyms.\\
The following example: #32 synset has 5 direct hyponyms which are #77393, #64712, #51671, #37744, #27392:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./output/wordnet/hyponyms.csv

| 32 | 77393 | 64712 | 51671 | 37744 | 27392 |
#+END_EXAMPLE


* Analyses
** Average word length history
[[./output/pics/word_length.png][analysis1]]\\
*Observation:*\\
The average word length was slowly increasing across the history and reached its peak at 6.947 chars/word in 1979.\\
** socialism vs. capitalism
[[./output/pics/ideology.png][analysis2]]\\
*Observation:*\\
The two ideology were mentioned most around 1940 and 1980. They are losing momentum quickly in recent years.\\
** Hyponyms of increase vs. decrease
[[./output/pics/hyponyms_pie.png][analysis3]]\\
*Observation:*\\
People didn't tend to use "decrease" to express its meanings. It wasn't even among the top 15 of its own hyponyms.\\
** Zipf's Law
[[./output/pics/zipfs.png][analysis4]]\\
*Observation:*\\
All loglog plots show a straight line, which means rank 1 (most popular) word is used twice as often as rank 2 (2nd most popular) word, 3 time as often as rank 3 word etc. It's an interesting observation since the ranking of a word shouldn't have any numerical properties.\\
** Four classical elements
[[./output/pics/hyponyms_box.png][analysis5]]\\
*Observation:*\\
Many words have derived meanings from the 4 classical elements. In 2000 their "strength" is in the order of air > earth > water > fire. Words relating to "fire" is barely used.
